## User Story
Given I am a poor soul looking to watch my favorite shows and movies at a reasonable price,   
I want an app that allows me to see which shows and movies are on which streaming services and allows me to compare prices. 
When I open the app  
Then I am asked to Log In to my own account or Create a new one   
When I am logged in  
Then I am able to select a store, search for products, or edit my account   
When I select a store  
Then I am able to view a store's list of products, place an order, view any previous orders for this store, or edit the current stock of any items.  
When I select search for products  
Then I am able to search for a list of products by using its category type (ie: Oscillator, Clock)  
When I select edit my account   
Then I am able to edit any of my saved information or view any previous orders I may have placed in the past
